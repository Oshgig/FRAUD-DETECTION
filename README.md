# FRAUD-DETECTION

Optimized Threshold Voting Ensemble Classifier for Credit Card Fraud Detection



PROJECT OVERVIEW

AIM


The aim is to accurately predict fraudulent activities and reduce the classification of non-fraudulent activities as fraudulent.







OBJECTIVES


a.	Analysing the capability of some machine learning models and deep learning model and its capability in its precision of detecting fraud
b.	Implementation of a voting ensemble method to combine the strength of the base models
c.	Evaluate the performance of the ensemble method and its optimised threshold use




DATASET


This project utilizes a publicly available credit card transaction dataset [https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=1597&sort=runs]. Appropriate data  processing and feature engineering would be required to prepare the dataset for modelling
