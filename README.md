# FRAUD-DETECTION

DEVELOPING A TRANSFERABLE VOTING ENSEMBLE MODEL FOR IMPROVING CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION PRECISION


PROJECT OVERVIEW


This project aims to develop a transferable model for generalizing  credit card fraud detection for improving precision. The ensemble model combines the strengths of multiple base model to enhance fraud detection performance while maintaining high recalll and low false positive.


MOTIVATION



OBJECTIVES


•	Development and training of modeling algorithms for developing a transfer model in credit card fraud detection 
•	Evaluating the models based on their precision, recall, ROC, and confusion matrix
•	The combination of the evaluated models with their great predictive nature using the Voting Ensemble model
•	Deployment of predictive  model
•	Threshold setting to determine when a transaction should be flagged as potential fraud


DATASET


This project utilizes a publicly available credit card transaction dataset [https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=1597&sort=runs]. Appropriate data  processing and feature engineering would be required to prepare the dataset for modelling
